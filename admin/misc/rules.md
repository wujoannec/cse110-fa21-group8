# Team 8 “The Software Devils” Working Agreement
## Fall 2021
### Created on 10/10/2021

1. **Primary Means of Communication and Expectations**
- *All members will be expected to read emails from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 12 hours.*
- *All members should communicate their progress with the other members of their team often and inform them about any issues they may have with completing their tasks.*
- *All members must use Slack, Discord, and Zoom as the main forms of communication.*
- *Standup notes about a member’s current progress will be given by each member every other day. This can be done over slack or discord.*

2. **Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)**
- *Agreed upon means of scheduling meetings. (Example: Team will agree, at the end of each class, to set any meetings times and agenda needed before the next class and beyond if possible. Team members will take turns to send out a reminder of the meeting with an agenda within eight hours after the class.)*
- *Meetings will be scheduled based on the poll of people’s schedules.*
- *Members will have a weekly consistent meeting time where everyone can be present (currently discussed weekend evenings/nights).*

3. **General Responsibilities for All Team Members**
- *All members will be expected to follow academic integrity policies of the class/university at all times.*
- *All members will be collaborative and make an effort to maintain psychological safety.*
- *All members will be expected to show up to relevant meetings on-time and participate.*
- *All members will make their deadlines or inform the group if they need help.*
- *All members will bring up any issues they may be having with another member in a productive manner.*

4. **Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines**
- *All members will show up to scheduled meetings on time (late with adequate excuse and adequate amount of notice)*
- *All members will be expected not to procrastinate on given assignments or duties, if time permits.*

5. **Conflict Resolution**
- *Each team should have an agreed-upon approach to addressing issues that may arise. For example, if a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to do X [specific action decided by the team] to address the problem before bringing the issue to a TA or professor.*
- *If a team member is not meeting deadlines, we agree to first find out if there are any external issues causing delays, and then assist in completing the assigned task by dividing up the work if need be.*
- *Guide the team member or members facing the issue to a middle ground or a potential solution.*

6. **Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s**
- *If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the TA Raaghav, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.*
