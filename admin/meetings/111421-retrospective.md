# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## What went well?

- Having a basic grid layout of the web pages
- Pair programming 
- Research in Spoonacular API & deciding backend structures
- Met our sprint goals
- Having multiple small meetings with respective team (UI) really helped us narrow scope
- Have a basic testing workflow
- Research about testing applications 
- Progress one inch one day
- Start from demos
- Daily standups

## What didnâ€™t?
- Organization -> no proper communication
- Lacking a clear workflow
- Trying to work on same file in Github (merge issues)
- Spoonacular API queries require money if too many
- We switched the testing tool which has wasted some exploring efforts
- Need to switch a testing person to backend
- Redundant ids/classes for CSS 
- Did not check GANTT chart
- Lack communication between teams (used DM instead of team Slack channels)

## What do we want to try next?
- Communicate more, have a better structure
- Connect frontend with backend to create a basic functioning webapp
- Create documentation and diagrams of functionality/interactions for each page
- Pair programming (Joanne + Ryan)
- Improve testing workflow to work with pull requests
- Polish web page UI designs
- Create a user login & data storage system
- Work together with testing teammates more 
- Create functions for hooking up info to recipe cards
- Use Slack channels more

## What puzzles us?
- Keeping up to date with the workflow (with outside issues into consideration)
