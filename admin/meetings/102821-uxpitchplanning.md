### Discussion Notes:
1. Pitch PowerPoint:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A5ZgRxxHWWwKL8DblLcOzZzsflPXpbO_5WhHYscwpt4/edit#slide=id.gfcaa35fd7c_2_5

2. Concerns about tooltips for when users input own recipe (alternative/misspellings of cooking terms)
  - Spell checker/suggestions? ignore non-matching terms?


### Decisions: 
- Different layout of edit/create recipe
  - Mirror the recipe view page, but with places to edit (doesn't allow user to change layout)

- Features focus on inexperienced/young adult users (doesn't stop anyone/more experienced chefs from using or benefiting from app)

- Navigation bar (removed redundant options)
