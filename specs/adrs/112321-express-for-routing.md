# Use Express to Handle Routing and Navigation

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to have a simple and easily navigatable website and proper routing is necessary for that.
What is the most efficient way to handle routing with our current tech stack?

## Considered Options

* Router.js class similar to Lab 7
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Express, because

* Connecting the client side to a node.js server and a mongodb database becomes much easier and has less extraneous code
* Express has a lot of documentation and guides to help with development so progress is made steadily and without hindrance
* The backend team has some experience using Express already as well as opposed to little to no experience with Router.js files
