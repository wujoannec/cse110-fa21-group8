# Use MPA for managing the web pages

## Context and Problem Statement

We want the user to be able to click from page to page with ease.
What tool should we use to do so?

## Considered Options
- SPA
- MPA

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: MPA

This is because using MPA was the most efficient and familiar way to connect multiple pages among the group. Thus, it fits our time constraint while also being perfectly effective for what we want our page to be able to do.
