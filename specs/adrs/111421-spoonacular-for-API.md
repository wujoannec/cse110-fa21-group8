# Use Spoonacular as our Recipe API

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to have access to a consistently formatted list of recipes.
Which API/format would allow access to the best recipes?

## Considered Options

* [Spoonacular API](https://openbase.com/js/spoonacular_api)
* [Edamam API](https://openbase.com/js/edamam-api)
* [Chomp API](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/chomp)
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Spoonacular API, because

* Spoonacular has access to the largest amount of recipes as opposed to the other two options
* The functionality and capabilities of it far surpass the other two options
* The Spoonacular API has tried and tested apps that utilize its features so its easier to see real world implementations
* Spoonacular website has a lot of easy to understand documentation. So does YouTube.
